This folder contains several datasets and documnets pertaining to the first Capstone project that involves taking three 
NBA datasets - career length, salary, and stats - and combining them into one so that it can be analyzed for relationships
between player performance and salary.


nba_data_cleanup.ipynb             Jupyter Notebook file of the data cleanup process involved in taking three datsets and 
                                   combining them into one.
nba_final_dataset.csv              final dataset that combines all three original datasets.
nba_career_final.csv               final career dataset.
nba_salary_final_done.csv          final salary dataset. 
nba_stats_final_nodupes.csv        final stats dataset. There are still issues with it (it contains several null values)
                                   but there aren't any duplicate rows. The null cleanup was saved for the final dataset. 
nba_career_fixed.csv               initial career set that only had minimal cleaning.
nba_salaries_fixed.csv             initial salaries set that only had minial cleaning.
nba_season_stats_p.csv             inital stats set with, again, minimal cleaning.
nba_data_story.ipnyb               Jupyter Notebook file of the data story, which includes several graphs of trends in the NBA
                                   dataset originally created in the nba_data_cleanup file.
exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb    Jupyter Notebook file of NBA data anlysis, still a work in progress.                          

Documents folder                   currently contains the original project proposal and the data wrangling summary.
